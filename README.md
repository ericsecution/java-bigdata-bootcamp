# java-bigdata-bootcamp
I'm working to create a Course that also builds an object-detection model builder, while teaching the user how to work with Java to access BigData, as well as working with APIs and YOLO Object-detection.

# Object Detection Model Builder

This project is a bootcamp for Java BigData Developers. It teaches you how to build object detection models using YouTube videos.

The project uses the following technologies:

* Java
* IntelliJ IDEA

The PERN stack:
* PostgreSQL
* pgAdmin
* Express.js
* React
* Node.js
* VSCode

BigData Building:
* Hadoop
* Spark
* Hive
* Hibernate
* Spring Boot

Deployment:
* Deployed via Google Cloud

Object Detection
* YOLO v7 

APIs
* YouTube API

# Features

This Project will have the following features:

* Users can submit prompts to the app, which will then generate a list of YouTube videos that match the prompt.
* Users can then select the videos that they want to analyze.
* The app will use YOLO v7 Object Detection to analyze the videos and identify the objects in each video.
* The app will then generate a report that summarizes the results of the analysis.
* The report will include charts and graphs to visualize the data.
* Users can share their reports with other users.
* Users can also collaborate on projects with other users.

# Intended storage

The project will store the following data:

* User profiles
* User prompts
* YouTube video urls
* Object detection results
* Reports

The data will be stored in a MongoDB database.

## User profiles

User profiles will include the following information:

* Username
* Email address
* Password
* Discord username

## User prompts

User prompts will include the following information:

* Prompt text
* Date and time of submission
* List of selected YouTube video urls

## YouTube video urls

YouTube video urls will include the following information:

* Video id
* Video title
* Video thumbnail
* Video length

## Object detection results

Object detection results will include the following information:

* Object name
* Object confidence score
* Object bounding box

## Reports

Reports will include the following information:

* Prompt text
* List of selected YouTube video urls
* Object detection results
* Charts and graphs
* Date and time of generation

## Community

The project also includes a Discord server where users can share their models and collaborate on projects.

The goal of the project is to build a community of object detection model builders who can work together to solve some of society's largest problems.

## Security

The project takes security seriously. It uses strong passwords, two-factor authentication, data encryption, vulnerability scanning, and security updates to protect user data.

## Monitoring

The project is monitored to ensure that it is running properly and to identify any potential problems. This is done using log monitoring, health checks, and alerts.

## Testing

The project is thoroughly tested to ensure that it is working properly and that it meets the user's requirements. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

- I'm using **cypress** for integration testing
- and **jest** for unit testing

## Funding

This project may be too expensive to run without some funding, as there are several AI tokens that will be required, a secure server to host the web application, as well as multiple API calls that will need to be made.

- It's recommended that you reading this should feel some sense of obligation to make this app a reality and... just kidding (or, well, half-joking--please feel free to contact me to assist with making this app come alive!)

Aside from initial funding assistance, this app will aim to ultimately generate funds from: 

- fees collected off of a crypto token 
- and/or NFT sales
- as well as having some paid tiers for greater user control and for larger data sets and builds (i.e. FREE, Developer, Professional, and 'Enterprise' levels).

### Wait? What's This? Why 'web 3'?


Good eye there. 

Since you asked, let me also share another Goal for this Project:

**The Web 3 Goal**

To set a precedent, as a 'Bridge App' (a phrase that I'm borrowing and reappropriating here), explained in a bit more detail in the following 5 points: 

1. - an app that *bridges* together Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Blockchain technology (i.e. NFTs, trustlessness, and the ability of 'web 3' to build instantly-empowered Communities).

2. - this specific goal is to piggy-back off of the recent popularity of both AI and NFTs, and to use that interest to draw-in enough people to help us to establish a standard for both 'verification' of ownership, as well as the 'reputation' of the Owner.

3. - as this is a goal for a future iteration of the app, we won't have any of that on the initial version(s), but we'll leave room for it, and get people smarter than me to help decide on the best way to implement it.

4. - this goal is in place to help provide another 'layer of security' (i.e. the 'social currency' layer), where we can maintain privacy (and even anonymity) of individual contributers and users within this app / Community, but also have a way of tracking their contributions, to create accountability thru visibility of some sort of ranking system, etc.

 5. - this will have the added benefit of creating a built-in system for creators and builders of our modular Object-Detection models to get credit (in the form of both social currency and also *actual* currency--either from the ability to trade NFTs, access a Marketplace, and/or license their models out; and/or through a residual payment from some sort of token, based on contributions and reputation, which can also be gained through Posting, Teaching, developing, and anything else that the Community decides)

## Next steps

The next steps for the project are to:

* Complete the development of the project, including adding in Monitoring, Security, and Testing
* Launch the project on the web (or at least via GitHub)
* Grow the Community of object detection model builders
* Solve some of Society's largest problems
* or, at the least: 
    * to create discussion around responsible development (i.e. developing within AI and blockchain in a way that promotes transparency, security, and open user tracking, so that new users can more safely access new technology, with less worry on if they're going to get burned / scammed or not by bad actors)
