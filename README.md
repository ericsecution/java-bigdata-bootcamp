# java-bigdata-bootcamp
I'm working to create a Course that also builds an object-detection model builder, while teaching the user how to work with Java to access BigData, as well as working with APIs and YOLO Object-detection.

# Object Detection Model Builder

This project is a bootcamp for Java BigData Developers. It teaches you how to build object detection models using YouTube videos.

The project uses the following technologies:

* Java
* IntelliJ IDEA
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* React
* Next.js
* Hadoop
* Spark
* Hive
* Hibernate
* YOLO Object Detection

# Features

The project will have the following features:

* Users can submit prompts to the app, which will then generate a list of YouTube videos that match the prompt.
* Users can then select the videos that they want to analyze.
* The app will use YOLO Object Detection to analyze the videos and identify the objects in each video.
* The app will then generate a report that summarizes the results of the analysis.
* The report will include charts and graphs to visualize the data.
* Users can share their reports with other users.
* Users can also collaborate on projects with other users.

# Intended storage

The project will store the following data:

* User profiles
* User prompts
* YouTube video urls
* Object detection results
* Reports

The data will be stored in a MongoDB database.

## User profiles

User profiles will include the following information:

* Username
* Email address
* Password
* Discord username

## User prompts

User prompts will include the following information:

* Prompt text
* Date and time of submission
* List of selected YouTube video urls

## YouTube video urls

YouTube video urls will include the following information:

* Video id
* Video title
* Video thumbnail
* Video length

## Object detection results

Object detection results will include the following information:

* Object name
* Object confidence score
* Object bounding box

## Reports

Reports will include the following information:

* Prompt text
* List of selected YouTube video urls
* Object detection results
* Charts and graphs
* Date and time of generation

## Community

The project also includes a Discord server where users can share their models and collaborate on projects.

The goal of the project is to build a community of object detection model builders who can work together to solve some of society's largest problems.

## Security

The project takes security seriously. It uses strong passwords, two-factor authentication, data encryption, vulnerability scanning, and security updates to protect user data.

## Monitoring

The project is monitored to ensure that it is running properly and to identify any potential problems. This is done using log monitoring, health checks, and alerts.

## Testing

The project is thoroughly tested to ensure that it is working properly and that it meets the user's requirements. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

## Funding

The project will generate funds from fees collected off of the token and/or NFT sales, as well as having some paid tiers.

## Next steps

The next steps for the project are to:

* Complete the development of the project
* Launch the project on the web
* Grow the community of object detection model builders
* Solve some of society's largest problems
